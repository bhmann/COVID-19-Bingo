## Description
Are you stuck working from home during the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak? Find yourself in lots of Slack/Teams/Webex/Zoom meetings for hours of the day?  Missing the social aspects of your office and struggling to find joy in the workday?

**_Install the COVID-2019 Bingo! PowerApp today_**

This Power App uses trite and cliche work from home tropes (that we all experience **EVERY.SINGLE.DAY.**) to play digital bingo. Whether it's seeing a rouge child hovering in the background of someone's video screen or the mandatory five minute small talk about the weather in every call, this game will keep you entertained all day long. With over 8x10^41 board variations... you'll never have the same board twice!
